                    I believe everyone should have some basic understanding of finance.  Some level is needed in all walks of life whether you own a business, are managing a department, directing a non-profit or simply for your own personal budgeting.  The good news is that I can show you the path to make it less intimidating and you more valuable.

            <span style="font-weight:900">ISSUE: </span> <b>Elderly Woman Thinks She is Running Out Of Money</b>
        </p>
            
        <p>
            This woman worked until age 80 and was always conservative with her money.  She paid off her house many years ago and had money in the bank. As a matter of fact, she probably had a similar amount in the bank in 2022 as she did in 1992.  Being conservative and investing in safe vehicles like CD's gave her the false security that she would always be financially well off.  
        </p>
        <p>
            In reality, she ended up losing most of her purchasing power due to the debasement of the dollar (inflation).  By age 93 she started feeling the pressure of her static bank account with rising prices and seeked help trying to understand where she stood budget wise. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <span style="font-weight:900">SOLUTION: </span>  <b>Create a Budget to Remove Fear</b> 
        </p>
        <p>
            By itemizing her revenue and expenses, I was able to provide her with a snapshot of where her financials are today.  By her being able to view the figures in a coherent fashion (instead of assumptions and guesswork) she was able to interpret my analysis and have the confidence that assuming no major changes in expense, she would have ample funds to survive and be able to stay in her own home.  Not only that, we were able to budget a small monthly donation so she can continue to support the charities she believes in.

        </p>
        <p>
            This gentleman recently became part owner of his company and needed a better understanding of financials to participate more confidently in owner review meetings. Although he was an expert in his construction field and knew the operations in and out he felt a bit lost during the financial review meetings and wanted to step up his game.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span style="font-weight:900">SOLUTION: </span>  <b>In Depth Review of the Actual Reporting Tools Used in His Business</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            He reached out to me with some examples of the various reports that were used for review and I presented to him a couple of days later with my insight and analysis on each of them. The thorough review and Q&A session with me got him coached up so that his business meetings would no longer be intimidating and so that he could participate and provide insight that should help increase his business' profitability over time.

            <span style="font-weight:900">ISSUE: </span>  <b>Non-Profit Needs a Financial Revamp for their Annual Gala</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            The group’s one and only fundraiser wasn’t being maximized to its potential.  Many small non-profits are operated by volunteers so sometimes the mindset is that any money raised is good (lack of accountability since no one is getting paid).  In my view, regardless of who runs an operation, the goal should be to maximize revenue for the charitable organization.  This particular group was experiencing stagnant profits for their annual event and yet it seemed as if each year the task was getting more and more difficult and consuming increased man hours.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span style="font-weight:900">SOLUTION: </span>  <b>Analyze and Think Through Every Line Item</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            I made the initial time investment to dig deep into each line of revenue and expense to determine opportunities for positive change.  By doing a simple analysis of the admission cost vs. expense we were able to identify that the group was actually paying people to attend their event!  By analyzing line item expenses, we were able to easily view each cost and identify cheaper alternatives.  Needless to say, between these changes and numerous others, we were able to more than double the profits from the prior year event.

            The common thread with these three examples is that they all required help.  None of them desired to be experts in finance they just needed a little bump in the right direction.  It was a helpless feeling for them not having the confidence or knowledge to take control of their unique situations.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, basic analytical and finance skills are not typically taught in traditional schools. Taking a long class at a university would not have solved their individual problem nor would going to a financial advisor.  Because of the lack of available solutions, most people sweep their problems under the rug and continue to do things like they always do.

            <b>ABOUT ME</b>
        </h2>

        <p>
            Growing up in Colorado gave me a great appreciation for the outdoors.  Having close ties, I get back to the state quite often to enjoy whatever outside activity presents itself.  In 1996 I moved to Las Vegas, NV to attend college at UNLV.  After spending nine years in the hospitality industry, I moved back to Denver to attend graduate school.  Full of confidence after obtaining an MBA in August of 2008, I returned to Las Vegas just to find the economy on the brink of collapse. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Although there were many tough years, having gone through the Great Recession was actually a blessing in disguise.  While attending grad school and observing the Las Vegas realty market from afar, I discovered Austrian economics.  Studying the classic works not only provided answers to the economic crisis at the time but also provided insight as to how to get through it.  Due to the dire economy, I was challenged to rethink the mainstream outlooks and conventional teaching that had been so consistent throughout my formal education.   
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding the principles of the Austrian school has served me well as I look to create value in all of my professional endeavors.  Knowing that value is subjective, I am aware that the best service, products and education must be produced for a business to sustain itself.  I’ve followed these principles in my various careers and have found success through different industries and in all levels of management.  As a proponent of volunteerism, I have also executed this same approach with the numerous non-profit Board positions that I have had the pleasure of being a part of.   
        </p>
        <p>
            The trend for the last few decades has shown that although people are earning more money, they are making less progress in their ultimate goals with less free time to pursue their true interests.  Those on a fixed income find their standard of living deteriorating year after year and for those who followed the rule of saving their money are realizing they’ve lost all of their purchasing power.  I am hopeful that soon, sound money will return which would be a benefit to us all.
